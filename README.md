# Door-Alarm-System
In this project, we are going to make a door alarm system using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic sensor used in this project is used as a distance sensor, it will tell us the distance at which the object is placed. Using this distance value, we will turn the buzzer on or off.
